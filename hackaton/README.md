  DART, WEB DEVELOPMENT AND PYTHON HACKATON PROJECTS

  #DART
  1. Write a Dart program using variables to display your name, age, school, and a hobby. Print it in one logical     sentence.
  2. Write a Dart program that performs two mathematical operations using functions.
  3. Write a Dart program to determine the grade based on a student's marks. The program should print out the   appropriate grade according to the following criteria:

      If the marks are greater than 85, print "Excellent".
      If the marks are between 75 and 85 (inclusive), print "Very Good".
      If the marks are between 65 and 75 (inclusive), print "Good".
      If the marks are below 65, print "Average".


#PYTHON
1. Functions & Fibonacci Sequence
Write a Python program to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term n. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

Your program should:
Ask the user to input the value of n.
Create a function that takes n as a parameter and returns a list containing the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
Print the generated Fibonacci sequence.
2. Python Conditional Statements
Example code is here

Create a Python program that:
Prompts a user to enter their age.
Uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
Prints You are eligible to vote if true, otherwise You are not eligible to vote
